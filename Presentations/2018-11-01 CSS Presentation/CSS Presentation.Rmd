## Intro
### This Will Not Be Enough

* I'm not here to make you statisticians over night.  
* I'm here you familiarize you with statistical concepts that might appear when you dabble in ML/DS/CSS.

### Probability

The Sum Rule

$$ p(X) = \sum_Y P(X,Y) $$
The Product Rule

$$ P(X,Y) = p(Y|X)P(X)  $$


### We Can Recover Bayes' Rule

\begin{align*}
P(Y|X) &= \dfrac{P(X,Y)}{P(X)}\\\\
       &= \dfrac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{\displaystyle{\sum_Y} P(X|Y)P(Y)}
\end{align*}
